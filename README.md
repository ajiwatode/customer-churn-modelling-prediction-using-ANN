# customer-churn-modelling-prediction-using-ANN
Churn prediction aims to detect customers intended to leave a service provider.Here the prediction is done on bank customers.This modelling enables the companies or organisations to identify the areas where they lag behind, thereby enabling them to rectify those issues and also aid in increasing the retention rate.he machine learning technique used in this project is Artificial Neural Network without momentum.

# Overview

This project involves building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting customer churn. The dataset used contains various customer attributes, and the ANN is trained to predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank.
